This is a code test assignment for Platform Science completed by Mary Maguire

Questions I would want to ask about product requirements:
I would ask for app UI mock ups
Verify that a "Y" counts as a vowel in the evaluation algorithm
Will our evaluation ever have to consider names that use non English characters or symbols?
Do we need to consider trimming white space off of input?  
Is it possible to have more than one driver with the same name
Is it possible to have more than one shipment with the same destination
The instructions say that we get this data every day, I'd be curious about what that means for policies around storing and refreshing data. Will the data will be provided by a network call eventually? New json files every day seems unlikely.  


Thoughts while working through the code test
Was the inclusion of the json data as an image instead of text intentional? If an interviewee mistranslates that data it will result in incorrect suitability scores.
I'm a bit surprised by the request to post this to a public repository, it means you can search through GitHub or other sites and find the solutions other people have completed. In past work places, we have requested just an exported zip from a private repository then one of our devs would set the project back up in our own internal GitHub so multiple developers could still view the code and the commit history.
The amount of computation necessary for this problem is overly high for an Android app. If this came up in real life I would suggest that the computation happen on a much more robust computer with the results provided to the app via some endpoint.
