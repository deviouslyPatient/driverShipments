/*
Thoughts:
I went through a lot of different approaches to this trying to consider what kind of data structures
would be the best for generating the permutations, whether it would be more performant to create a
data class for the drivers so that I would only have to compute the number of vowels and consonants
once, and whether or not a recursive function was the best idea. If I had more time I would have
liked to do more research and maybe taken some performance metrics on different approaches.

Potential issues with this approach:
If there are ever drivers with the same name, or shipments with the same destination then only one
will be considered
For very large lists of drivers and/or shipments this could lead to stack overflow issues.
